# House Rental Management System

## Overview

The **House Rental Management System** is a console-based Java application designed to simplify the management of house rentals. It enables users to manage properties, tenants, bookings, and payments, with data persistence through file handling. This project serves as both a practical tool for rental management and an educational resource for learning core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file I/O, and exception handling.

## Features

- **Property Management**:
  - Add new houses with details like ID, location, price, bedrooms, and owner
  - Remove houses that are not currently booked
  - Search for available houses by location and price range

- **Tenant Management**:
  - Register tenants with name, contact information, and preferred location
  - Match tenants with available houses based on their preferred location

- **Booking & Payments**:
  - Book a house for a tenant and generate a lease agreement
  - Record payments for lease agreements and track payment history

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Save house and tenant data to `houses.txt` and `tenants.txt` files
  - (Optional) Save rental agreements to `agreements.txt` for persistent storage

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core Java with OOP principles
- **File I/O**: `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` for reading and writing data to files
- **Java Streams**: For efficient filtering and processing of house and tenant data
- **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions and input validation for robustness
- **Thread Safety**: Synchronized methods for booking operations to ensure thread safety

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- A terminal or command prompt to compile and run the application
